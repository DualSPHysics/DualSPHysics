FloatingInfo v5.4.266.01 (09-04-2025)
======================================
LoadDsphConfig> .../bin/windows/DsphConfig.xml
Information about parameters of execution:

  FloatingInfo <options>

  Basic options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -ver           Shows version information
    -opt <file>    Loads configuration from a file

  Define input data:
    -dirdata <dir>   Directory with floating data (PartFloatInfo.ibi4)
                     or main output directory for VRes simulations
    -dirdatax <dir>  Same as -dirdata option but loads data with extra
                     frequency (PartFloatInfo2.ibi4)

    -first:<int>     Indicates the first file to be computed
    -last:<int>      Indicates the last file to be computed
    -files:<values>  Indicates the number of files to be processed

  Define output files:
    -savedata <file>    Generates CSV file with data of floating
    -savemotion:<0/1>   Includes motion data (1 by default)
    -onlymk:<values>    Indicates the mk of selected floatings

    -createdirs:<0/1>   Creates full path for output files
                        (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 1)
    -csvsep:<0/1>       Separator character in CSV files (0=semicolon, 1=coma)
                        (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 0)

  Information on output data stored by DualSPHysics on floating bodies:
    fvel [m/s]..........: Linear velocity of the floating body.
    fomega [rad/s]......: Angular velocity of the floating body.
    center [m]..........: Position of the centre of mass.
    surge [m]...........: Displacement of the centre of mass in X.
    sway [m]............: Displacement of the centre of mass in Y.
    heave [m]...........: Displacement of the centre of mass in Z.
    roll [deg]..........: Rotation on the X-axis.
    pitch [deg].........: Rotation on the Y-axis.
    yaw [deg]...........: Rotation on the Z-axis.
    face [m/s^2]........: Linear acceleration (calculated from linear velocity (v_t1-v_t0)/dt).
    faceomega [rad/s^2].: Angular acceleration (calculated from angular velocity (v_t1-v_t0)/dt).
    extforcelin [N].....: External linear forces (moorings and imposed forces).
    extforceang [Nm]....: External angular forces (moorings and imposed forces).
    fluidforcelin [N]...: Linear forces from fluid (sum in eq.48, Dominguez et al 2022).
    fluidforceang [Nm]..: Angular forces from fluid (sum in eq.49, Dominguez et al 2022).
    pre-acelin [m/s^2]..: Linear acceleration before constraints (includes external forces and gravity).
    pre-aceang [rad/s^2]: Angular acceleration before constraints (multiplied by rotated inertia tensor).
    *** Note that the sign of pitch has changed since v5.0.204
