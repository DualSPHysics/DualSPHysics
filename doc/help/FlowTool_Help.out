Information about parameters of execution:

  FlowTool <options>

  Basic options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -ver           Shows version information
    -opt <file>    Load configuration of a file

  Defines input file:
    -dirdata <dir>    Directory with particle data (Part_XXXX.bi4)
    -filedata <file>  File with particle data (file.bi4)

    -fileboxes <file> File with definition of domains using prisms (txt or xml)
    -first:<int>     Indicates the first file to be computed
    -last:<int>      Indicates the last file to be computed
    -files:<values>  Indicates the number of files to be processed

  Defines output file:
    -templates            Creates example file to be used with -fileboxes
    -savecsv <file.csv>   Generates CSV files with number of particles that
                          enter or leave the domains, volume and flow rates
    -units:1  Define units for volume or flow and saves extra flow data between
              control boxes (0:by default, 1:l/s, 2:gal/s, 3:gal/min)

    -savevtk <file.vtk>   Creates VTK (polydata) files with particles

    -createdirs:<0/1>     Creates full path for output files
                          (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 1)
    -thousands:<0/1>      Use thousands separator (value by default is read
                          from DsphConfig.xml or 0)

    -threads:<int>  Indicates the number of threads for parallel execution of
     the interpolation, it takes the number of cores of the device by default
     (or using zero value).

  Examples:
    FlowTool -dirdata . -fileboxes boxes.txt -savecsv resul.csv -savevtk dir/files.vtk
