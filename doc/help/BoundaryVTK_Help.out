BoundaryVTK v5.0.122 (09-07-2020)
==================================
LoadDsphConfig> .../bin/windows/DsphConfig.xml
Information about parameters of execution:

  BoundaryVTK <options>

  Basic options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -ver           Shows version information
    -opt <file>    Loads configuration from a file

    -info          Shows information of loaded data

  Load shapes:
    -loadvtk <file.vtk>  Loads shapes from vtk files (PolyData). The keyword
                         [CaseName] is replaced by name of case and wildcards
                         are allowed
    -loadvtk AutoActual  Loads shapes from files *_Actual.vtk generated by
                         GenCase v4.0.074 (or higher)
    -loadvtk AutoDp      Loads shapes from files *_Dp.vtk like previous one
    -onlymk:<values>     Indicates the mk of the shapes to be loaded, affects
                         only the previous -loadvtk instruction and can not be
                         used with -onlyid
    -onlyid:<values>     Indicates the code of object of the shapes to be
                         loaded, only affects the previous -loadvtk instruction
    -changemk:<value>    Changes the mk of the loaded shapes to a given value,
                         only affects the previous -loadvtk instruction 

    -loadply:<mk> <file.ply>  Loads shapes from ply files with indicated mk
    -loadstl:<mk> <file.stl>  Loads shapes from stl files with indicated mk

  Load configuration for a mobile boundary:
    -filexml file.xml    Loads xml file with information of the movement and
                         types of particles. The word 'AUTO' can be used to
                         load the xml used in the simulation when -motiondata
                         or -motiondatatime is used

    -motiontime:<time>:<step> Configures the duration and time step to
                         simulate the movement defined in the xml file, 
                         can not be used with -motiondatatime and -motiondata

    -motiondatatime <dir>  Indicates the directory where real times of the
                         simulation are loaded for the mobile boundary
                         Can not be used with -motiontime and -motiondata

    -motiondata <dir>    Indicates the directory where position of particles
                         are loaded to generate the mobile boundary
                         Can not be used with -motiontime and -motiondatatime

    -motiondata0 <dir>   It is only for restart simulations. Indicates the
                         directory where is the file Part_0000.bi4 to load
                         initial positions of particles.
                         Can not be used with -motiontime and -motiondatatime

  Define output files:
    -savevtk <file.vtk>  Generates vtk(polydata) files with the loaded shapes
    -saveply <file.ply>  Generates ply file with the loaded information
    -savestl <file.stl>  Generates stl file with the loaded information
    -savevtkdata <file.vtk>  Generates vtk(polydata) file with the loaded
                         shapes including mk and shape code

    -savemotion <file>   Generates csv file with movement of the objects
    -saveposmotion:<mk>:x:y:z <file>   Generates csv file with updated position
                         according movement of mk boundary
    -onlytype:<values>   Indicates the type of selected mk of the shapes to be
                         stored, affects only the previous out option and cannot be
                         combined with other filters
                         (+ means include, - means do not include)
           +/-all:       To choose or reject all options
           +/-fixed:     Boundary fixed particles
           +/-moving:    Boundary moving particles
           +/-floating:  Floating body particles
    -onlymk:<values>     Indicates the mk of the shapes to be stored, affects
                         only the previous out option and cannot be combined
                         with other filters
    -onlyid:<values>     Indicates the code of the object of the shapes to be
                         stored, affects only the previous out option and cannot
                         be combined with other filters
    -filemove <file>     Loads file with displacement

    -createdirs:<0/1>    Creates full path for output files
                         (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 1)
    -csvsep:<0/1>        Separator character in CSV files (0=semicolon, 1=coma)
                         (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 0)

  Examples:
    BoundaryVTK -loadvtk bound.vtk -savevtk box.vtk -onlymk:10,12

    BoundaryVTK -loadvtk *_Actual.vtk -filexml AUTO -motiondata .
    BoundaryVTK -loadvtk file.vtk -filexml case.xml -motiondata .
                -saveply motion.ply
