    -pointspos <file>  Defines the position of points where interpolated data
                       will be computed (each line contains the points for one
                       part file, points are defined as x0;y0;z0;x1;y1;z1...)
    -particlesmk:<values>  Indicates the points where interpolated data will
                           be computed using the positions of the particles 
                           with the given mk

    -particlesid:<values>  Indicates the points where interpolated data will
                           be computed using the positions of the particles

    -kclimit:<float>       Defines the minimum value of sum_wab_vol to apply
                           the Kernel Correction (default value = 0.5)
    -kcdummy:<float>       Defines the dummy value for the interpolated
                           quantity if Kernel Correction is not applied
                           (default value = 0)
    -kcusedummy:<0/1>      Defines whether or not to use the dummy value
                           (default value = 1)

    -distinter_2h:<float>  Coefficient of 2h that defines the maximum distance
                           for the interaction among particles depending on 2h
                           (default value = 1.0)
    -distinter:<float>     Defines the maximum distance for the interaction

    -elevation[:<float>]  Fluid elevation is calculated starting from mass 
                     values for each point x,y. The reference mass to obtain
                     the elevation is calculated according to the mass values
                     of the selected particles; by default 0.5 in 3D (half 
                     the mass) and 0.4 in 2D

    -elevationlimit:<float>  The same as -elevation but the reference mass is
                             given by an absolute value

    -elevationoutput:<value> Output files with fluid elevation values
       time:        Values of elevation for each time (option by default)
       pos:         Values of elevation for each position (x,y)
       all:         Both output files.

  Define output files format:
    -savevtk <file.vtk>   Generates VTK(polydata) file with the given
                          interpolation points
    -savecsv <file.csv>   Generates one CSV file with the time history
                          of the obtained values
    -saveascii <file.asc> Generates one ASCII file without headers
                          with the time history of the obtained values

    -createdirs:<0/1>     Creates full path for output files
                          (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 1)
    -csvsep:<0/1>         Separator character in CSV files (0=semicolon, 1=coma)
                          (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 0)

  Examples:
    MeasureTool -points fpoints.txt -onlytype:-all,fluid -savecsv dataf
    MeasureTool -points fpoints.txt -vars:press -savevtk visupress
