    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -ver           Shows version information
    -opt <file>    Loads configuration of a file

  Define input file:
    -dirin <dir>       Directory with particle data
    -filexml file.xml  Loads xml file with information of mk to
                       save value of mk
    -first:<int>     Indicates the first file to be computed
    -last:<int>      Indicates the last file to be computed

  Define output file:
    -savevtk <file.vtk>     Generates vtk(polydata) files with excluded
                            particles.
    -savecsv <file.csv>     Generates CSV file with particles info
    -SaveResume <file.csv>  Generates CSV file with resume info

    -createdirs:<0/1>  Creates full path for output files
                       (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 1)
    -csvsep:<0/1>      Separator character in CSV files (0=semicolon, 1=coma)
                       (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 0)

  Configuration for output file:
    -onlypos:xmin:ymin:zmin:xmax:ymax:zmax  Indicates limits of particles
    -onlynew  Stores only new excluded particles of each PART file (default
     value = false)
    -limitpos:xmin:ymin:zmin:xmax:ymax:zmax Changes limits of simulation
    -limitrhop:min:max      Changes limits of rhop values
