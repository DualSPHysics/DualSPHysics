TracerParts v5.0.206 (12-04-2023)
==================================
LoadDsphConfig> .../bin/windows/DsphConfig.xml
Information about parameters of execution:

  TracerParts <options>

  Basic options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -ver           Shows version information
    -opt <file>    Load configuration of a file
    -threads:<int>  Indicates the number of threads for parallel execution.
     Uses 0 to take the number of cores of the device (default=1).

  Defines input file:
    -dirin <dir>       Directory with particle data bi4
    -filexml file.xml  Loads xml file with information of mk and
                       and other information. The word 'AUTO' can
                       be used to load the xml used in the simulation.
    -first:<int>       Indicates the first file to be computed
    -last:<int>        Indicates the last file to be computed
    -files:<values>    Indicates the number of files to be processed

  Defines output file:
    -savevtk <file.vtk>   Generates vtk(polydata) files with particles
    -createdirs:<0/1>     Creates full path for output files
                          (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 1)

  Selection of particles:
    -onlymk:<values> Indicates the mk of selected particles
    -onlyid:<values> Indicates the id of selected particles
    -onlypos:xmin:ymin:zmin:xmax:ymax:zmax  Indicates limits of particles
    -onlytype:<values>   Indicates the type of selected particles
       (+ means include, - means do not include)
       +/-all:       To choose or reject all options
       +/-bound:     Boundary particles (fixed, moving and floating)
       +/-fixed:     Boundary fixed particles
       +/-moving:    Boundary moving particles
       +/-floating:  Floating body particles
       +/-fluid:     Fluid particles (no excluded)
       (Preselected types: all)

    -nearpartsdef:<def>  Definition of points to select the nearest particle. It
       uses the same point definition format used by MeasureTool:
           pt=<x>:<y>:<z>,pt=<x>:<y>:<z>...
           ptls[x=<x0>:<dx>:<nx>,y=<y0>:<dy>:<ny>,z=<z0>:<dz>:<nz>]...
           ptels[x=<x0>:<dx>:<xf>,y=<y0>:<dy>:<yf>,z=<z0>:<dz>:<zf>]...
    -nearpartsdist:<float>  Defines the maximum distance to select the nearest
       particles (default: no limit).

    -limit:<int>     Limits number of selected particles (def=28118)
    -limitrnd:<int>  Random seed for selection according to limit number (def=8)

  Configuration for tail:
    -tailsize:<int>  Indicates the number of steps to create the tail (def=20)
    -maxdist:<float> Indicates the maximum distance to draw lines (def=0)
    -drawpoints      Draws only points
    -drawlines       Draws lines between points (default)

    -vars:<values>   Indicates the stored variables of each particle
       +/-all:         To choose or reject all options
       +/-id:          Id of particle
       +/-vel:         Velocity
       +/-index:       Index of particle in selection
       +/-tail:        Distance from the head
       (Preselected variables: index,tail)

  Examples:
    TracerParts -onlyid:10-20,50-60 -savevtk dir/files.vtk
