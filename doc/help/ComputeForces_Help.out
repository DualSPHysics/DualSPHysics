====================================
LoadDsphConfig> .../bin/windows/DsphConfig.xml
Information about parameters of execution:

  ComputeForces <options>

  Basic options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -ver           Shows version information
    -opt <file>    Loads configuration of a file

  Define input file:
    -dirdata <dir>     Directory with particle data (Part_XXXX.bi4)
    -filexml file.xml  Loads xml file with information of mk and
                       and other information. The word 'AUTO' can
                       be used to load the xml used in the simulation
    -first:<int>       Indicates the first file to be computed
    -last:<int>        Indicates the last file to be computed
    -files:<values>    Indicates the number of files to be processed

    -threads:<int>  Indicates the number of threads for parallel execution of
     the interpolation, it takes the number of cores of the device by default
     (or uses zero value)

  Define parameters for force calculation:
    -viscoart:v:vbf  Artificial viscosity [0-1] (vbf:ViscoBoundFactor) 
    -viscolam:v:vbf  Laminar viscosity [order of 1E-6] (vbf:ViscoBoundFactor)
    -viscoauto       Viscosity config. is load from BI4 files (default option)
    -gravity:<float:float:float> Gravity value

    -balance         Compute mass and center.x/y for floating balance

  Define axis for moment calculation:
    -momentaxis:x1:y1:z1:x2:y2:z2  Axis for intrinsic moment calculation (old)

    -momentaxisin:x1:y1:z1:x2:y2:z2:name  Intrinsic moment calculations
    -momentaxisex:x1:y1:z1:x2:y2:z2:name  Extrinsic moment calculations
    -momentin_xyz:x1:y1:z1  Intrinsic moment calculations in axis X,Y,Z
    -momentex_xyz:x1:y1:z1  Extrinsic moment calculations in axis X,Y,Z
           (Intrinsic: axis moves and rotates with the body)
           (Extrinsic: axis moves but does not rotate)

  Define filter options for BOUNDARY particles:

    *** Note that when generating CSV/ASCII output the filter cannot include
        particles from one floating body with particles from another
        floating body or another type of boundary particles.

    -onlypos:xmin:ymin:zmin:xmax:ymax:zmax  Indicates limits of particles
    -onlypos:xmin:ymin:zmin:xmax:ymax:zmax  Indicates limits of particles
    -onlyposfile filters.xml  Indicates XML file with filters to apply
    -onlymk:<values>     Indicates the mk of selected particles
    -onlyid:<values>     Indicates the id of selected particles
    -onlyidfile <file>   Indicates the id of selected particles by TXT file
    -onlyzone:<values>   Indicates the VRes zone of selected particles
    -fixedfilter         The initial particle selection is maintained.

  Define output file:
    -savecsv <file.csv>   Generates one CSV file with the time history
                          of the obtained values. Check above for filter
                          restrictions when generating CSV output.
    -saveascii <file.asc> Generates one ASCII file (without headers) with
                          the time history of the obtained values. Check above
                          for filter restrictions when generating ASCII output.
    -savevtk <file.vtk>   Generates VTK files with selected particles


    -createdirs:<0/1>    Creates full path for output files
                         (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 1)
    -csvsep:<0/1>      Separator character in CSV files (0=semicolon, 1=coma)
                       (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 0)

  Information on output data:
    ForceFluid [N]: Linear forces from fluid (sum in eq.48, Dominguez et al 2022).
    Weight [N]....: Gravity x Mass of floating body (only for floating bodies).
    ForceTotal [N]: Sum of ForceFluid and Weight (only for floating bodies).
    Moment(s) [Nn]: Moment of forces along a given axis (when is requested).
    *** Note that the sign X,Y,Z-axis moment of force has changed since v5.0.205

  Examples:
    ComputeForces -onlymk:10 -viscoauto -savecsv results
    ComputeForces -onlymk:10 -momentaxisex:7:2:3:7:2:4:eMz -savecsv results
    ComputeForces -onlymk:10 -momentex_xyz:7:2:3 -momentin_xyz:7:2:3 -savecsv results
