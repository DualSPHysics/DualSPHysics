====================================
LoadDsphConfig> .../bin/windows/DsphConfig.xml
Information about parameters of execution:

  ComputeForces <options>

  Basic options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -ver           Shows version information
    -opt <file>    Loads configuration of a file

  Define input file:
    -dirin <dir>       Directory with particle data
    -filexml file.xml  Loads xml file with information of mk and
                       and other information. The word 'AUTO' can
                       be used to load the xml used in the simulation
    -first:<int>       Indicates the first file to be computed
    -last:<int>        Indicates the last file to be computed
    -files:<values>    Indicates the number of files to be processed

    -threads:<int>  Indicates the number of threads for parallel execution of
     the interpolation, it takes the number of cores of the device by default
     (or uses zero value)

  Define parameters for force calculation:
    -viscoart:<float>      Artificial viscosity [0-1] (0 by default)
    -viscolam:<float>      Laminar viscosity [order of 1E-6]
    -viscoauto:            Viscosity configuration is load from BI4 files
    -gravity:<float:float:float> Gravity value

  Define axis for moment calculation:
    -momentaxis:x1:y1:z1:x2:y2:z2  Axis for moment calculation

  Configuration for each output file:
    -onlypos:xmin:ymin:zmin:xmax:ymax:zmax  Indicates limits of particles
    -onlyposfile filters.xml  Indicates XML file with filters to apply
    -onlymk:<values>     Indicates the mk of selected particles
    -onlyid:<values>     Indicates the id of selected particles

  Define output file:
    -savecsv <file.csv>   Generates one CSV file with the time history
                          of the obtained values
    -saveascii <file.asc> Generates one ASCII file without headers
                          with the time history of the obtained values
    -savevtk <file.vtk>   Generates VTK files with selected particles

    -createdirs:<0/1>    Creates full path for output files
                         (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 1)
    -csvsep:<0/1>      Separator character in CSV files (0=semicolon, 1=coma)
                       (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 0)

  Examples:
    ComputeForces -onlymk:10 -savecsv results
