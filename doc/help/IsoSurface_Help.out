       +/-ace:       Acceleration
       +/-vor:       Vorticity
       +/-XXX:       Variable defined by the user
       (Preselected variables: vel)

  Define parameters for acceleration or vorticity calculation:
    -viscoart:<float>      Artificial viscosity [0-1]
    -viscolam:<float>      Laminar viscosity [order of 1E-6]
    -gravity:<float:float:float> Gravity value

  Set the configuration of interpolation:
    -distinter_2h:<float>  Coefficient of 2h that defines the maximum distance
                           for the interaction among particles depending on 2h
                           (default value = 1.0)
    -distinter:<float>     Defines the maximum distance for the interaction
                           among particles in an absolute way.

    -kclimit:<float>       Defines the minimum value of sum_wab_vol to apply
                           the Kernel Correction (default value = 0.05)
    -kcdummy:<float>       Defines the dummy value for the interpolated
                           quantity if Kernel Correction is not applied
                           (default value = 0)
    -kcusedummy:<0/1>      Defines whether or not to use the dummy value
                           (default value = 1)

     variable given and using the limit values.

    -saveslice <file.vtk>  Generates VTK files (polydata) with the slice of 
     isosuface. 
    -slicevec:ptx:pty:ptz:vecx:vecy:vecz  The plane of slice is defined using
     a point and a vector. The slice configuration is automatically defined for
     2-D simulations. Several definitions can be used.
    -slice3pt:pt1x:pt1y:pt1z:pt2x:pt2y:pt2z:pt3x:pt3y:pt3z  The plane of slice
     is defined using three points. The slice configuration is automatically
     defined for 2-D simulations. Several definitions can be used.
