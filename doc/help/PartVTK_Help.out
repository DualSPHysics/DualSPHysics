==============================
LoadDsphConfig> .../bin/windows/DsphConfig.xml
Information about parameters of execution:

  PartVTK <options>

  Basic options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -ver           Shows version information
    -opt <file>    Loads configuration of a file

  Define input file:
    -dirin <dir>       Directory with particle data
    -casein <casename> Name of case file with particle data

    -filexml file.xml  Loads xml file with information of mk and
                       and other information. The word 'AUTO' can
                       be used to load the xml used in the simulation.
    -first:<int>     Indicates the first file to be computed
    -last:<int>      Indicates the last file to be computed
    -files:<values>  Indicates the number of files to be processed

    -continue:<0/1>  Process only new VTK files (default=false)

    -move:x:y:z      Particles are moved using this offset

    -threads:<int>   Indicates the number of threads for parallel execution of
     the interpolation, it takes the number of cores of the device by default
     (or uses zero value).

  Define parameters for acceleration or vorticity calculation:
    -viscoart:<float>      Artificial viscosity [0-1]
    -viscolam:<float>      Laminar viscosity [order of 1E-6]
    -gravity:<float:float:float> Gravity value
    -distinter_2h:<float>  Coefficient of 2h that defines the maximum distance
                           for the interaction among particles depending on 2h
                           (default value = 1.0)
    -distinter:<float>     Defines the maximum distance for the interaction
                           among particles in an absolute way.

  Define output file:
    -savevtk <file.vtk>    Generates vtk(polydata) files with particles
                           according to the filters with options onlymk,
                           onlyid and onlytype
    -saveascii <file.asc>  Generates ASCII files without headers

    -savecsv <file.csv>    Generates CSV files to use with calculation sheets
    -savestatscsv <file.csv>  Generates CSV files with statistics

    -createdirs:<0/1>    Creates full path for output files
                         (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 1)
    -csvsep:<0/1>       Separator character in CSV files (0=semicolon, 1=coma)
                        (value by default is read from DsphConfig.xml or 0)

  Configuration for each output file:
    -onlypos:xmin:ymin:zmin:xmax:ymax:zmax  Indicates limits of particles
    -onlyposfile filters.xml  Indicates XML file with filters to apply
    -onlyvel:vmin:vmax   Indicates the velocity of selected particles
    -onlymk:<values>     Indicates the mk of selected particles
    -onlyid:<values>     Indicates the id of selected particles
    -onlytype:<values>   Indicates the type of selected particles
       (+ means include, - means do not include)
       +/-all:       To choose or reject all options
       +/-bound:     Boundary particles (fixed, moving and floating)
       +/-fixed:     Boundary fixed particles
       +/-moving:    Boundary moving particles
       +/-floating:  Floating body particles
       +/-fluid:     Fluid particles (no excluded)
       (Preselected types: all)

    -vars:<values>  Indicates the variables to be computed and stored
       (+ means include, - means do not include)
       +/-all:       To choose or reject all options
       +/-idp:       Id of particle
       +/-vel:       Velocity
       +/-rhop:      Density
       +/-press:     Pressure
       +/-mass:      Mass
       +/-vol:       Volume
       +/-type:      Type (fixed,moving,floating,fluid)
       +/-mk:        Value of mk associated to the particles
       +/-ace:       Acceleration
       +/-vor:       Vorticity
       +/-XXX:       Variable defined by the user
       (Preselected variables: idp,vel,rhop,type)

    -symparts:<0/1>  Adds mirrored particles from symmetry data to VKT files
       (default value=0)

  Examples:
    PartVTK -savevtk partfluid.vtk -onlytype:-bound -filexml dir/AUTO
            -savevtk partbound.vtk -onlytype:-all,bound -vars:vel.x,var1
