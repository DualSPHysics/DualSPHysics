- GenCase: New option AutoFill in <drawfilestl>, <drawfilevtk> and <drawfileply> to fill external geometries automatically.


DualSPHysics Package v4.4 (11-04-2019)
=======================================
- Coupling with chrono
  - Folder in examples\chrono
  - XML templates in doc\xml_format: _FmtXML_Chrono.xml
- Coupling with wave propagation models
  - Folder in examples\wavecoupling
  - XML templates in doc\xml_format: _FmtXML_MLPistons.xml & _FmtXML_RelaxationZones.xml
- Open boundaries; inlet and outlet conditions
  - Folder in examples\inletoutlet
  - XML templates in doc\xml_format: _FmtXML_InOut.xml
- Gauge system to measure water level, fluid velocity and forces during the simulation.
- Several improvements in Chrono feature:
  - Several links with the same bodies are allowed since the name is corrected automatically.
  - PointLine link also defines not spheric joints using rotvector and rotvector2.
  - Improved representation of PointLine link.
- ReadSwash2: Allows the use of DYN as NONST in SWS files.
- ComputeForces: Allows to compute moment about an axis.
- Solitary waves: Generation using 3 different theorie & multiple solitary waves.
- Damping: Saves VTK scheme of damping configuration and improves XML configuration to define domain for damping.  
- Motion constraints for floating bodies using SPH, DEM or Chrono.  
- Simulationdomain: New definition of domain limits.

  
DualSPHysics Package v4.2 (04-06-2018)
=======================================
- Updates Visual Studio project and makfiles for CUDA 9.2.
- Code changes to improve compatibility with new features.
- DualSPHysics output data directories are created automatically when necessary.
- Updates post-processing tools for automatically creating the output directories
- Updated examples using new features on automatic output directory creation.
- Important improvements in wave generation:
  - Computes X-velocity for irregular 2nd order waves.
  - Velocity for regular waves 1st and 2nd order using flaps is saved in CSV files.
  - The theory for 2nd order irregular waves using flap was implemented.
- Minor fixes:
  - CaseDambreak_FileBoxes.txt
  - Fixed Makefiles for Linux when gcc 5 is used.
  - EXP_FloatingWavesVal_Hadzic_et_al_2005.ods
